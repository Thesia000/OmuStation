  # Roleplay Rule 4 - 'It's what my character would do' is not a valid excuse.

  D&D players have likely heard this one before. "It's what my character would do," is not a valid excuse for bad behavior.
  You control the character, and you decided how the character would act and behave.

  Roleplay may be king, but if your character would constantly be doing something that would break the server rules, then you shouldn't be playing that character.

  # Precedents
  - "My character has anger issues" is not a valid reason to over-escalate and/or kill somebody.
  - "But my character WOULD fall to nepotism!" is not a good enough reason for you to start metafriending, and giving your friends all-access as captain.
  - "But my character is paranoid!" is not a good enough reason to start powergaming.
  - "But my character hates NanoTrasen!" is not a good enough reason to start self-antagging or being an excessive nuisance.
