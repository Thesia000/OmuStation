  # Roleplay Rule 3 - Every shift is just another day.

  While your character may or may not know that nukies, blobs, and other antags exist, they shouldn't be expecting them for no reason.
  You go into a shift expecting this to be just another day at work.

  Remember, [italic]nothing ever happens[/italic], and if something did happen last time, surely it won't happen again! Right?

  If you are playing a paranoid character, make extra sure you are not valid-hunting or powergaming because of it.
