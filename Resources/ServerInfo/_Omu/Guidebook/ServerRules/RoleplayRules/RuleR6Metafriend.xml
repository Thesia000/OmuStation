  # Roleplay Rule 6 - Don't metafriend/metagrudge.

  Characters are allowed to have persistent relationships/friendships/rivalries across rounds, and remember information from previous rounds; however, in-character relationships should not be used to gain an unfair advantage and shouldn't devolve into metagrudging either.

  Additionally, do not play a character to only interact with a specific person or people, and ignore everyone else.

  ## Precedents
  - Character friendships should not be used to gain an unfair advantage. Having an in-character friendship with another player does not, for example, justify giving them all-access each round.
  - Character rivalries don't justify metagrudging or [textlink="self-antagging" link="RuleSelfantag"].
  - Character relationships do not justify cross-teaming, such as helping out a changeling.
