  # Roleplay Rule 2 - Don't over-esalate

  Don't over-escalate. Someone calling you stinky is not a good enough reason for you to kill them.

  ## Precedents

  - Insults are not just reason for murder. But you can insult them back, or even beat them up depending on the intensity of the insult.
  - Respond with roughly equivalent force, if only a bit stronger. If you get called stinky, you could shove them. If someone shoves you, you could punch them back. If someone stabbed you, you could shoot them back.
  - Extreme in-character insults like speciesism allow you to skip straight to beating their ass.
  - Don't kill people or leave them to die. You should stop fighting as soon as someone is critical. Killing people is self-antagging. (Doing so accidentally is fine, but you should be dragging them to medical nonetheless.)
