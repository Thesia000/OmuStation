  # Roleplay Rule 5 - You are not the main character.

  Remember that you are not the main character. You are playing on this server with other people, and all of them are just as valuable. let others get their time in the spotlight.

  # Precedents
  - Your will not always be in the right, and that's okay.
  - You don't 'Deserve' to win a fight just because you wrote in your lore that your character is super-duper awesome and would have won.
  - The goal of this server is for everyone to tell a collaborative story. Not just you to tell your own.
  - Don't just charge nukies or other major antags with a mop just because. Unless you have a good in-character reason to fight, you should likely be running away.
  - Your character should show weakness and fear. In fact, it often makes for better stories if you do have character flaws and weaknesses.
  - Nobody likes a gary/mary sue.
