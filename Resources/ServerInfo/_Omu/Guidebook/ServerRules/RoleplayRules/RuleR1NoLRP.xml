  # Roleplay Rule 1 - Put effort into your Roleplay.

  Put effort into your RP. This is an MRP server, and the RP quality should be higher because of it. Try to be creative with emotes, and hold 'Yes, and' conversations.

  ## Precedents
  - Characters should remain consistent, and be deeper than just a single gimmick or joke. This also goes for character names,
  - It should make sense for your character to have the role they do. NanoTrasen wouldn't hire an extremely [textlink="Incompetent" link="RuleSkillIssue"] Captain.
  - Don't use text speech like "LMAO" and "BRB", unless you intend your character to be literally saying text speech like "LMAO" out loud.
