  # Rule 4 - Meet the roleplay standards

  This is an MRP server, where the main goal is to tell an engaging story. While you don't need to be writing a novel with every message, at least try to have interesting messages.

  ## Precedents

  - Don't use texting speech while talking. Nobody talks like that. (Unless your character is a weirdo who literally says 'oh em gee')
  - As fun as sitting in the bar and traumadumping your character's backstory is, there is a lot more to rp than doing just that.
  - Put effort into roleplaying. Cower in fear, scream in terror, laugh awkwardly at a bad joke, and try to do other such actions that make your character feel alive.
  - If you're making demands, or talking to someone in tense situation that could break into combat, let them finish responding before you make your attack.
