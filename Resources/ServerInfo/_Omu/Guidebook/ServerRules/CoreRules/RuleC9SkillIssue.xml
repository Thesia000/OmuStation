  # Rule 9 - Don't be excessively incompetent

  Everyone is unrobust at some point. Everyone is new, and learning is fine. That's what the learner roles are for, and incompetence is expected in them.
  However, being purposefully incompetent or willfully ignorant to the point in which you are actively self-sabotaging, repeatedly making poor decisions, and overall reducing the fun of the round should be avoided.

  A base level of competence is required for Command roles and Security (not including cadets) especially. NanoTrasen simply wouldn't hire someone who is dangerously incompetent.

  ## Precedents

  - Don't purposefully throw or self-sabotage because you are committing to a bit.
  - Don't abandon your job and role; either for in-character reasons or by disconnecting without warning.
  - If you are a member of Command/Dignitary, or an important role, please ahelp before heading to cryo or disconnecting if you can. (If not possible, at least inform your fellow Command/team beforehand.)
  - Everyone has emergencies and suddenly needs to go at times, so this rule is lenient. But if you consistently have to leave without warning, you probably should refrain from playing Command or Security.
