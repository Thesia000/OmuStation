  # Rule 3 - Keep IC and OOC Seperate

  Keep in character interactions in-character, and out-of-character interactions out of character.

  ## Precedents

  - Do not use the OOC nor LOOC chat to communicate in-character; such as using it to bypass speech restrictions.
  - Using LOOC to teach someone something that can't be taught in-character, such as the controls of the game, is fine.
  - Do not say LOOC or OOC things in-character, such as "I just joined the round,"; either say it in LOOC or say something like, "I just showed up to this shift."
