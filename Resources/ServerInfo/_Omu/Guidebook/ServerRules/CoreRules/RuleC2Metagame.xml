  # Rule 2 - Don't metagame/powergame

  I.e. don't use out of character knowledge in game.


  ## Precedents

  - You are allowed to be in a VC together, but you are not allowed to act on information that you obtained from the vc.
  - Streaming of the server is allowed. However if there's any indication that the stream is being used to metagame, such as a player watching the stream to gain information about the round, it will be treated as metacomms and dealt with accordingly.
  - You don't know the round type. You shouldn't start hunting for a blob just because there have been no meteorites, and unless you have a good in character reason, you shouldn't be expecting antags to just show up.
  - Recalling knowledge and experiences from previous rounds is NOT metagaming.
  - You shouldn't be grabbing/preparing equipment for no IC reason, also known as 'Powergaming'.
