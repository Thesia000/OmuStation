  # Core Rule 1 - Don't be a dick.

  Be excellent to each other. If you enjoy trying to ruin someone else’s good time, you won’t have a place here. Being a jerk in-character is fine to a point, but being a jerk out of character is not welcome.
  Remember to seperate the player from the character. While someone may be rude in game, remember that it is a fictional persona.

  Note that you should be especially careful of this when interacting with admins.
  You're likely angry if you're ahelping, but try to keep it civil, as admins are people too.
  Also, people in general are more likely to listen to you if you are being civil.

  ## Precedents

  - Being excessively rude and annoying or simply 'ragebaiting' people is not allowed.
  - Any action done with the intent to upset people out of character is not allowed.
  - Spamming the chat is not allowed.
  - Joining and exiting the round in an attempt to maximize antagonist rolls is not allowed.
  - Anything else that just generally ruins or worsens the round and fun for others. Use common sense, and be nice out of character.
