  # Rule 4 - Don't Self-antag

  While you can be rude, hold grudges, and even be a nuisance to an extent. You shouldn't cause any serious damage or harm to crew as a non-antagonist.

  ## Precedents

  - Don't start random fights without an in-character reason, also known as 'RDM' (Random Death Match). A drunken bar fight over an argument is fine, randomly attacking people in the halls because 'your character is insane' is not.
  - Don't over-escalate. Someone calling you stinky is not a good enough reason for you to kill them. (See the roleplay rule [textlink="don't over-escalate" link="RuleEscelation"].)
  - Don't round remove people as a non-antagonist.
  - Don't sabotage the station as a non-antagonist. Vandalizing the front of security is fine, smashing their windows and doors is not.
  - Don't steal important items as a non-antagonist. Hacking into a vending machine to steal some insuls is fine, stealing the spare ID is not.
  - Silicons following their laws are not self-antagging, but can be punished for excessive leaps of logic to perform self-antag-like actions.
  - Clowns and Mimes are largely exempt from the self-antag rules, and [bolditalic][color=#ffaa00]only the self-antag rules[/color][/bolditalic]. They still [textlink="shouldn't be a dick." link="RuleDontBeADick"] This also goes for acts taken against clowns and mimes.
