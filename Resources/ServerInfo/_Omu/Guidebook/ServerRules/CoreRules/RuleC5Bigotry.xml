  # Rule 5 - No Bigotry

  Bigotry such as real life slurs, including ones such as 'r*tard', are not allowed.
  Speciesism is allowed, as long as it is not directly referencing a real life slur.

  ## Examples

   - Calling an IPC clanker is fine. Going 'My clanka' is not, as you are now referencing a real life slur.
   - The classic SS13 lizard slur is an absolute no. You cannot take the N word, and just replace the N with an L.
