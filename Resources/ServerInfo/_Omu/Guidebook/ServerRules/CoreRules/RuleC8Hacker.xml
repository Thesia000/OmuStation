  # Rule 8 - No hacking, exploiting, or using macros.

  This rule should be self self-explenatory. Any external tool or program used to gain an advantage or modify the client in some way that gives you an advantage is not allowed.

  ## Precedents

  - Do not use any external software to give yourself an unfair advantage over other players.
  - Do not modify your game client in any way that gives you an unfair advantage over players nor for any malicious reasons.
  - Do not use macros, which are any scripts, programs, or in-built hardware features, to automatically execute a series of inputs. (Using the game's built-in feature of binding a key to a command is allowed. Using a program to execute several movements which are not possible in-game is not.)
  - Do not exploit a known bug to make yourself invulnerable in combat or otherwise give yourself an unfair advantage.
  - Do not intentionally lag or attempt to crash the server or other players.
  - Exceptions for external accessibility tools may be considered. If you need to use them, please run them by an admin.
