  # Rule 6 - No Explicit/Shock Content

  This is a 16+ server, so there are minors here. While you don't have to keep it family-friendly, ERP (Erotic Roleplay) is strictly prohibited.

  ## Precedents

  - Absolutely no Erotic Roleplay. The occasional sex joke or innuendo [bolditalic]MAY[/bolditalic] be fine in-context; however don't make a habit out of it. Making people uncomfortable is unacceptable.
  - No Shock content, whether sexual or gory in nature.
  - Language, as long as it is [textlink="not bigotry" link="RuleBigotry"], is fine. Feel free to cuss like a sailor!
